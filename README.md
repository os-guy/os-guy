## Hi

I'm that **OpenSource Guy** who loves **OpenSource** stuff.

I'm a Turkish guy and trying to improve my coding knowledge.

I'm currently working on my Hyprland Dotfile, [Serial Design V](https://github.com/os-guy/Serial-Design-V).
Yes, the name can sound familiar.
I was a fan of the **MURDER DRONES** animation series, and loved V so much.
My friend [KhazarOS Linux](https://github.com/khazar-os-linux) told me that, naming the project as Serial Design V would be better for me and as you might already noticed, V is not used as a letter in the name, it's used as the Roman Numeral of 5 cuz I had **4** trial versions before that project.

And you might say, "yo, why did u put some unnecessary text to ur profile?".
Cuz **I love putting texts** here and there.
